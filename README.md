# Portfolio_TJ

My personal portfolio, showing off some of my projects

This page contains a nav section, with the "about me", "contact me" and "project" links directing to the relevant areas on the page. The Resume link prompts you to download my resume. The projects section has links to access all 5 projects, not all of which are currently filled, while the contact me has links to my Email, (opens with email app) and LinkedIn

I'm not super happy with the result, i unfortunatly spent alot of time trying to get something to work that eventually just didnt look good, and i just dont have enough time to fix it.

I will be redoing this page as i add more projects
