# Portfolio_TJ

My personal portfolio, showing off some of my projects

I'm not super happy with the result, i unfortunatly spent alot of time trying to get something to work that eventually just didnt look good, and i just dont have enough time to fix it.

I will be redoing this page as i add more projects
