My personal portfolio, showing off some of my projects

## About

This page contains a nav section, with the "about me", "contact me" and "project" links directing to the relevant areas on the page. The Resume link prompts you to download my resume. The projects section has links to access 5 of my finished projects, while the contact me has links to my Email, (opens with email app), LinkedIn, and my Github page

## Further Updates

This website will be updated as I complete my course, by adding more functionality and links to my future projects
